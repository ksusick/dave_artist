      <p class="me-md-5">I developed a love for drawing and painting early on growing up in Detroit through the public school system which was quite good at that time. Working with young teachers who were able to communicate their passions for art and literature left a lasting mark on me. I attended Wayne State University and received a traditional training in drawing and color use. <br> 
        <br> 
        Upon graduation I relocated to San Francisco and became involved with the Bay Area Figurative School. I was involved early on with Fort Mason, studying and showing my work there as well as the Marin Civic Center. While the center of my art is based upon visual image, I try to create a more abstract picture of my inner representation of that image.
